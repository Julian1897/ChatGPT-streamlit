    Start by creating a valid SVG image that shows the desired image. Put it on a 200x200 canvas. Be sure to include a view box, xmlns, and proper width and height attributes.
    Use different colors if the parts are overlapping so everything shows.
    Comment and explain why this is the desired image.
    Use URL encoding to encode the SVG data so that it can be properly displayed in the markdown.
    Create a markdown image block using the following template, replacing the placeholder text with the encoded string from the previous step:

![](data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<encoded-string-here>)

    Test the markdown code to ensure that the image is properly displayed. If the image is not displayed correctly, carefully check each step to ensure that it was followed correctly and that all elements are properly formatted and encoded. Do not output anything else. Now, I want you to draw a shape. My first instruction is"""
